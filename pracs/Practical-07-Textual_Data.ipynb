The later parts are largely complete and ready to run; however, that *doesn't* mean you should just skip over them and think you've grasped what's happening and it will be easy to apply in your own analyses. I would *not* pay as much attention to LDA topic mining since I don't think it's results are that good, but I've included it here as it's still commonly-used in the Digital Humanities and by Marketing folks. Word2Vec is much more powerful: we'll use it this week to see how you can find similar words, next week we'll use it cluster *documents*."

    "The critical thing here is to understand how we'er initialising a plot that has **4 rows** and **1 column** even though it is only showing **2 plots**. What we're going to do is set the *first* plot to span **3 rows** so that it takes up 75% of the plot area (3/4), while the *second* plot only takes up 25% (1/4). They will appear one above the other, so there's only 1 column. Here's how to read the key parts of `subplot2grid`:\n",
    "- `nrows` -- how many rows *of plots* in the figure.\n",
    "- `ncols>` -- how many columns *of plots* in the figure.\n",
    "- `row` -- what row of the figure does *this* plot start on (0-indexed like a list in Python).\n",
    "- `col` -- what column of the figure does *this* plot start on (0-indexed like a list in Python).\n",
    "- `rowspan` -- how many rows of the figure does *this* plot span (*not* 0-indexed because it's not list-like).\n",
    "- `colspan` -- how many columns of the figure does *this* plot span (*not* 0-indexed because it's not list-like).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every tie you call `subplot2grid` you are initialising a new axis-object into which you can then draw with your geopackage or pandas plotting methods."
