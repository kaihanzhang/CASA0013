This week we want you to get a handle on pandas itself, so although we will do some plotting of charts, we'll focus on 3-4 with a tiny bit of 5. There will be much more on plotting charts next week, and you should be looking into 1 and 2 yourself based on what's been written both on the [Inside Airbnb web site](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html) and in the [suggested readings](https://github.com/jreades/i2p/blob/master/bib/Bibliography.md).\n",

    "\n",
    "Pandas can do a *lot*, and you might be feeling a little intimidated by this, but here's the thing: we were already writing something like pandas from scratch! That's because pandas takes a **column-view of data** in the same way that our **Dictionary-of-Lists** did, it's just that it's got a lot more features than our 'simple' tool did. That's why the documentation is so much more forbidding and why pandas is so much more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But at its heart, a pandas `Data Frame` (`df` for short) is a collection of `Data Series` objects (i.e. columns) with an index. Each Series is like one of our column-lists from the last notebook. And the `df` is like the dictionary that held the data together. So you've seen this before and you already _know_ what's going on... or at least you now have an _analogy_ that you can use to make sense of pandas:\n",

    "2. Using a dictionary syntax: `myDataFrame['column_name_1']`\n",

    "Kind of handy, no? These aren't the _best_ looking plots, but they are all being generated on-the-fly for you by pandas with no more than a cheery `DataFrame.Series.plot.<plot type>`! Since those plots are all just method calls, many of them take optional parameters to change the colour, the notation (scientific or not), and other options. For example, many of the documentation pages linked to above are rather brief, but include a link to [the general options that can be applied to all `Series.plot`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.plot.html) calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we like pandas: it allows us to be _constructively lazy_. We don't need to know _how_ a draw a KDE plot (though it always helps if you don't see what you expected), we just need to know that pandas provides a method that will do it for you. And _that_ is why it's always worth having a [look at the documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html). \n",
