This is also reliant on `matplotlib` and basically involves plotting items to _shared axes_ which is done by passing in `ax=<axis object>` to each `plot(...)`. By convention, if you only have a single figure (e.g. a single map) then you create an axis object and name it `ax` so you will see a lot of `ax=ax` code in graphing libraries, but `=ax` is just saying 'assign to the axis object that I created'.\n",

    "Since the axes are how you control what is shown, see if you can find out by Googling how to set the x- and y-limits on the map so that it shows only London and trims out the much larger area of water that is outside of the Greater London Authority. **As a rough guideline, this has the Easting range 501,000 to 563,000, and the Northing range 155,000 to 202,000.**\n",

If you are reading/writing a filename than ends in a valid extension (e.g. `.shp`, `.gpkg`, or `.geojson`) then GeoPandas will 'do the right thing'. Where you *may* run into trouble is if you are reading/writing a **URL** (e.g. [https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/data/src/Boroughs.gpkg**?raw=true**](https://github.com/jreades/fsds/blob/master/data/src/Boroughs.gpkg?raw=true)). With this URL ending in `?raw=true` there's no extension that GeoPandas can read so you *will* need to specify a driver. If in doubt, specify the driver as below:\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"><b>Clarification</b>: in this example we are reading from GitHub and I'm saying that we need to specify the driver. So why didn't we need to do with the <tt>cache_data</tt> function earlier as well? Well, this was a side-benefit of using the standard URL library: it <i>automatically</i> stripped off the query string (<tt>?raw=true</tt>) when I asked it for the file name, so we saved the file locally as a GeoPackage with <tt>.gpkg</tt> extension, which means that GeoPandas could read it without any problems.</div>\n",
