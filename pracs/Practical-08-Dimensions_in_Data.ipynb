    "A standard approach to Machine Learning, and something that is becoming more widely used elsewhere, is the splitting of a large data into set into testing and training components. Typically, you would take 80-90% of your data to 'train' your algorithm and withold between 10-20% for validation ('testing'). An even 'stricter' approach, in the sense of trying to ensure the robustness of your model against outlier effects, is [cross validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_validate.html) such as [k-folds cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html). Here we are just going to use it to explore the issues raised in normalisation and standardisation by the use of SciKit-Learn's pipeline architecture with streaming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Sci-Kit Learn is often used in a model-validation context in which we are trying to _predict_ something. So Sci-Kit Learn _expects_ that you'll have an `X` which is your **predictors** (the inputs to your model) and a `y` which is the thing you're **trying to predict**. We're obviously not building a model here (that's for Term 2!) so we'll just 'pretend' that we're trying to predict the price of a listing and will set that up as our `y` data set. Notice too that you can pass a data frame directly to Sci-Kit Learn and it will split it for you."
